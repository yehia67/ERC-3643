# ERC-3643

I created this repository to be able to use [Tokeny ERC-3643](https://tokeny.com/erc3643/) as a dependency with the foundry instead of depending on Hardhat.

The contract is flattened and hard to read to fix this please refer to [the original repository](https://github.com/ERC-3643/ERC-3643)
